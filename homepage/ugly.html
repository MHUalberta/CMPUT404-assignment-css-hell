                    <h2>Who is my cat?</h2>
                    <p>My cat is a cat who is 5 years of age and goes by the name Basbousa. Her name comes from a popular middle eastern dish that our family is very fond of, and hence we decided to give that name to this magnificent cat. Basbousa's hobbies include, but are not limited to: Scratching anything scratchable (including human skin), eating grass and throwing it up inside the house, head rubs (for around ~20 seconds before she gets bored and scratches your hand), and sniffing everything (yes everything...).</p>

                    <h2>The History Behind Basbousa</h2>
                    <p>Ever since she was born, Basbousa has been ageing rapidly as every year that passes she becomes older by a year! At the very young age of 2, she made her first friend, a white male cat named Eddie who's roughly double her size. They both shared the same hobby of laying down outside and doing absolutely nothing (with the occasionaly grass eating). Fast forward to today, she's still healthy and doing well and still as mischievous as ever as she near swallowed one of my most valuable quarter coins, valued at well over 24 cents.</p>

                    <h2>Basbousa's Experience</h2>
                    <p>Personally (and I'd love to be wrong) I do not think she possesses a lot of skills that could help her get hired in any technology-related field. Her only successful (and by successful I refer to code that could be compiled) edit to an exisiting codebase involved translating a python string I wrote from English to her native language ("Hello" --> "Helloasunauxbhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss").</p>
